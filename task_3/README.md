# Task 3

**You have a dataset (internship_train.csv) that contains 53 anonymized features and a target column.**
**Your task is to build model that predicts a target based on the proposed features.**
**Please provide predictions for internship_hidden_test.csv file. Target metric is RMSE.**

## The main goal is to provide github repository that contains
- jupyter notebook with analysis
-	code for modeling (Python 3)
-	file with model prediction
-	readme file
-	requirements.txt file



# Explatory Data Analysis

- Data info
- Searching for null and duplicate values
- Exploring relations among variables and target
- Searching for Outliers in dataset

# Modelling

- Importing data
- Splitting data into train and test for modelling and Scaling
- Modelling with Decision Tree Regressor
- Writing internship_hidden_test with new predicted values to new Hidden_test.csv
